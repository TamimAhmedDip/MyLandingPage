# MyLandingPage
CSS Landing Page Project of The Odin Project

I made this landing page about me. A basic description and some images. The hyper links are not activated. 
And a small bug I could not yet fix is that there is a small space around the whole webpage that seems like a white border. Can't get rid of it.
